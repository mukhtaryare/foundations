    "GeoPandas is a super useful library for geography, sure, but an important thing to know is that it's really like a glue that connects a lot of other libraries together. Mostly it sits of top of something called pandas, which is kind of like a very cool Python version of Excel, but there are a LOT of other packages it depends on, too.\n",
    "You sometimes come across those other packages when reading documentation or when trying to understand concepts or code, so it's important that you know at least a little bit about them. And to be honest, the toughest part of geopandas isn't using geopandas, it's installing all of these other pieces, so let's take a quick tour of them.\n",
    "When people deal with geographic shapes and files they use a lot of very specific tools. Most of those tools aren't Python tools, though, they live somewhere else on your computer. But since other tools are so great, a lot of our Python libraries just plug into them. So every time we look at a Python package, we'll probably also be talking about the non-Python software it's built on top of. They're the things that can make installing geopandas so difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First up, **Shapely**. Shapely is a library that deals with geometric shapes - points, polygons, things like that. Everything that's on a map is geometry, shapes or points, and it's shapely's job to take care of them. Shapely is based on software called GEOS, which isn't connected to Python but does all of the heavy lifting of geometric stuff for Shapely.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next up we have the Python package **Fiona**. Fiona is for reading and writing geographic files. Shapefiles, GeoJSON, any kind of format you can think of, Fiona should be able to read and write it. Except for CSV files, which is kind of weird, but we'll figure that one out when we come to it. In the same way that Shapely is built on top of GEOS, Fiona is based on a piece of software called OGR that reads and writes geographic files outside of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next we have **pyproj**, which deals with cartographic projections. People measure the Earth in different ways, and when they want to point to specific locations on Earth they might use different kinds of coordinates, and it's pyproj's job to keep track of all of the different techniques. pyproj is based on a piece of non-Python software called PROJ.4.\n",
    "Those are the major packages that geopandas uses, but a few more are\n",
    "descartes, which is for making visualizations of maps. It works hand-in-hand with matplotlib, which is a common Python visualization library\n",
    "\n",
    "* **geopy**, which is a geocoding library. That means it helps convert location names, like addresses or cities, to latitude and longitude pairs so you can map them\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rtree**, which is used for simple spatial analysis, like seeing whether a point is inside a polygon or whether a road goes through a neighborhood, things like that\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pysal**, which does complicated spatial analysis and some kinds of graph coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "* **numpy**, which is a standard Python heavy math library\n",
    "\n",
    "Now don't look at this big long list and get intimidated. That's a command! Not allowed to be scared!\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that there are ten thousand different packages working together doesn't make geopandas difficult. It can make installing geopandas tough, but geopandas itself exists so we don't have to think about all of these separate libraries. We mostly just talk to geopandas and it does all of the hard work for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that these libraries exist, though, and knowing what role they play in geopandas is really helpful. Because once we know about those packages, when we want to do something very very specific in geopandas, maybe we'll reach down past geopandas and say, hey let me just use shapely directly for a little while or let me save this file with some options I read about using Fiona, and it just makes us a lot more powerful.\n",
    "Most of the time, though, it's just us and geopandas having a good time."

    "When you're installing geopandas, you aren't just installing geopandas - you're installing a million and one things to go with it. Sometimes this can be a little tough, so I'm going to walk you through it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Geopandas is built on a few spatial technologies that aren't Python - most importantly, GEOS and GDAL. You can install them a handful of ways, but we're going to take the easy way out. The easy way out that also leaves our computer pretty clean, and makes it easy to uninstall if we need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to install this non-Python software using Homebrew, which, you followed my Python setup instructions, you have used before, so you won't need to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get installing.\n",
    "First, open up the Terminal. Once you're there, run the following commands, one at a time. They might each take a little time to download and install.\n",

    "\n",
    "These are all pretty standard packages to install, nothing too crazy should happen. The only weird thing is that basemap is installed directly from a file, while the others are installed by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up Terminal and use the following commands to install these packages. If your computer says pip3 doesn't exist, try it with pip instead. Hopefully it's for Python 3, especially if you followed my instructions from before.\n",

    "* pip3 install rtree\n",

    "There are a few more than geopandas relies on, too - shapely, fiona, descartes - but those should be automatically installed along with geopandas.\n",
